## Introduction

Large-Scale Learnable Graph Convolutional Networks provide an efficient way (LGCL and LGCN) for learnable graph convolution.

Detailed information about LGCL and LGCN is provided in (https://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=3219947).

## Start training

After configure the network, we can start to train. Run
```
python main.py
```
The training results on Cora dataset will be displayed.
